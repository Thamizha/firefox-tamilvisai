This project is originally maintained at http://tamilkey.mozdev.org/ . The code is now moved to github and will be maintained in github going forward.

The tamilkey is a keyboard extension for typing tamil in all mozilla products. Tamilkey will support most of the popular keyboard layouts used among tamils. currently tamilkey supports Anjal, Tamilnet99, Bamini, Old and New Tamil typewriter,Avvai keyboard layouts.

This project is inspired by Telugutoolbar and Russkey. And basic codes for this project is derived from the above two projects. I thank the project owners of telugutoolbar and russkey for their contributions which has helped me to create tamilkey.
